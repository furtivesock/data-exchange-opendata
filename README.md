# Data exchange assignment 1 - OpenData

Source code for the first assignment in Data exchange and representation course at Polytech Paris-Saclay engineering school.

## Introduction

The goal of this project was to merge three different OpenData datasets into one. We chose to find a relationship between Recent graduates employment, Unemployment and COVID-19 outbreak.

You can view the correlation graph by country here :

Data are missing for some countries due to the initial datasets, but you can find complete graphs for European countries especially.
